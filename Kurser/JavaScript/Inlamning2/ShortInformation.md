//This StarWars fan site is coded with pure Javascript, jQuery and Ajax API 
//The focus on this assigment was JavaScript, jQuery code and get it to work with an API. The layout is basic due to the focus.
//The cool part I like is how I connected the API and retrived information to the site, same goes to the random background pictures witch are from another sites API.
